# Cosmetics-t-SNE

This project explores a cosmetics dataset obtained from Kaggle, aiming to visualize the relationships between different cosmetic products based on their ingredients, price, rank, and effects 
on the skin. We employ t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), a powerful dimensionality reduction technique, to map the high-dimensional data into a 2D space for easy visualization 
and pattern recognition.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze the relationships between cosmetic ingredients, price, rank, and skin effects.
- Identify clusters of similar products and potential outliers.
- Uncover hidden patterns and correlations within the dataset.
- Provide insights for consumers to make informed choices and for manufacturers to improve product offerings.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the cosmetics dataset and perform basic data cleaning.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Select relevant features for t-SNE analysis, including price, rank, ingredient combinations, and skin effects.
3. **Feature Scaling:** Standardize the features to ensure they have a similar scale.
4. **t-SNE Application:** Apply t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 2 dimensions.
5. **Visualization:** Create a scatter plot to visualize the t-SNE results, coloring the points based on product rank.

## Insights

The t-SNE visualization reveals clusters of similar products based on their features, allowing for a better understanding of the relationships within the cosmetics dataset.
